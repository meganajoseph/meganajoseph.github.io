									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying data science with an emphasis in 
									robotics. In the past, I have worked as a tutor for various different organizations,
									such as Kumon, RISE, and Berkeley's Student Learning Center. I also have worked on
									a number of projects, my favorite being a voice controlled robot car. Currently, I 
									am finishing up my degree and tutoring. I plan to work on an embedded systems 
									project and a robotics project in the last year of college. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside of school, I enjoy reading historical fiction and playing on my Switch!

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<h4>Kumon</h4>
								<p>
									I started working my first job in the summer of 2019 as a grader at Kumon, an 
									educational center for children. My mother was the one who encouraged me to apply and 
									I have been there until August 2021 when I moved for college. I have always liked working 
									with kids and the idea of sharing my knowledge and skills was appealing to me. At this job, 
									I have learned so much in regards to communication, patience, discipline, and problem-solving. 
									I have formed close bonds with the students there and have fostered a safe space for 
									them to share vulnerable moments with me. I am eternally grateful to have been given the 
									opportunity to work here and I could not love this job more!
								</p>
								<h4>Private Tutoring</h4>
								<p>
									I started private tutoring kids in October 2020 until August 2021. It was honestly a completely new 
									experience for me since I had never tutored one-on-one completely by myself. Nevertheless, I went in 
									both excited and curious as to how I would help the students. It was definitely hard at first, 
									especially to get the kids to warm up to both me and learning outside of school. Now, both kids have 
									a great relationship with me and are willing and eager to learn. Making my own lesson plans based on what 
									they already know was a new experience for me, but I now know them well enough that it is easy for me 
									to create lessons. Watching them grow into better students always brings delight in my heart and I 
									am so excited to see how far they will go. I am happy to say that they were able to reach their grade 
									level and a little higher through my guidance. As a teacher, I am incredibly proud of their progress 
									and wish them all the best!
								</p>
								<h4>Pre-Calculus Essentials Tutoring</h4>
								<p>
									At this job, I was a teaching assistant for a pre-calculus course for freshmen at UC Berkeley. I did this
									in the summers of 2021 and 2022. It was a connecting course for incoming students to understand what 
									college mathematics is like and to prepare them for it. I led one or two groups where I reviewed material 
									they had learned that day and went over practice problems. This job required training where I learned 
									pedagogy, including different forms of active learning, and applied it to my work. I also participated 
									in communicating with my fellow tutors on different ways to engage students in activities. This job 
									allowed me to form bonds with the students and prepare them for the rigors of college, while also assuring 
									them that they are capable of achieving their goals. 
								</p>
								<h4>Python DeCal</h4>
								<p>
									I started teaching for the Python DeCal in Fall 2021 as an intern and am now the head instructor. It is a 
									student-led course that teaches Python geared towards astronomy students. I originally took the course 
									myself the previous semester when I was an intended astrophysics major. I really enjoyed the course and 
									decided to intern for it! Since I was unable to join synchronously, I was tasked with grading assignments. 
									It was not until the next semester that I became a full time instructor. I taught lectures, made Python 
									guides and held my own office hours. As head instructor, I take care of logistical tasks alongside my other 
									responsibilities. Through this, I have learned how to lead a team, teach larger groups of students, work 
									better with students one-on-one in person, communicate programming ideas, problem-solving, and collaboration. 
									I can't wait to see how the course develops as my team grows as teachers!

								<h4>S1XT33N</h4>
								<p>
									S1XT33N is a project I worked on in EECS16B which is an introduction course to 
									applied machine learning. The project involved making a robot car (named Honey) 
									that listens to voice commands and follows the specified path. We used a kit 
									that had all the parts but created the circuits and code on our own. We created 
									motor control circuits, regulator circuits, a mic board, and a low and high pass 
									filter. We also created a linear model to model the noise in the signal, used 
									feedback and a closed loop to ensure the car travels in a straight line and turns 
									properly, and used clustering analysis to classify words as commands. All programs 
									were written in C through an Arduino. The car is powered by batteries and used the 
									Arduino to collect data. The words we used as commands are "honey", "uu", "dddd", 
									and "durian". 
								</p>
								<p>
									This project has been one that I looked forward to since I deciede to pursue data 
									science. I became interested in robots in high school but never had the opportunity 
									to explore that interest until this class. My circuitry and debugging skills have 
									definitely improved while in this class. The hardest part of the project was picking 
									words as commands that had a good accuracy. A majority of the time, they classified 
									well in theory but not so much when we said the words to Honey. This project is my 
									favorite project that I've ever completed and I am excited to use the skills I've 
									gained and build upon them in future endeavors.

								<h4>Build Your Own World (BYOW)</h4>
								<p>
									Build Your Own World was a project for COMPSCI 61BL, a lab-based data structures and 
									algorithms class in Java. In this project, we made a pseudorandomly generated world 
									that changes depending on the input seed. It contained a main menu that allowed the 
									user to generate a world, load a saved world, pick an avatar, and name an avatar. The 
									world was made of tiles and we created an engine to generate the world. In each world, 
									the name of the avatar and the real date and time are displayed at the top of the viewer, 
									there are tiles that teleport the user to random locations in the map, tiles that triggered 
									an event game where the user had to collect all of the good coins and avoid the bad ones. 
									Winning an event game released a code word that the user needed to remember. After 
									clearing all the games, the user inputs the phrase made from the code words and, if it's 
									right, wins the game. This was the most fun I had in a project because I was able to directly 
									see how my code manifested something that I could directly interact with. We were unable to 
									implement the load feature in time but the rest of the project is complete. One thing 
									we wanted to implement was music and sound effects in the world. Since we had limited 
									time to complete the project, we decided not to add it. I learned how to use StdDraw and 
									how to use randomness in coding.

								<h4>Gitlet</h4>
								<p>
									Gitlet was also a project from COMPSCI 61BL. For this project, I made a version control 
									system similar to Git. We were able to implement saving directories, restoring versions, 
									viewing history, maintaining branches, and merging changes. This project was the most 
									challenging in the class as we were left entirely on our own with only a few functions 
									that may help us on the way. Despite this, we were able to implement every feature except 
									the checkout feature. Even though this was a hard project, I learned so much about data 
									structures and how to implement them in a real world setting. I also learned how to 
									create a project with just a few guidelines to go off of.
