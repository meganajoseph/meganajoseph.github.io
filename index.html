									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! I am a senior at UC Berkeley studying data science with an emphasis in 
									robotics. In the past, I have worked as a tutor for various different organizations,
									such as Kumon, RISE, and Berkeley's Student Learning Center. I also have worked on
									a number of projects, my favorite being a voice controlled robot car. Currently, I 
									am finishing up my degree and tutoring. I plan to work on an embedded systems 
									project and a robotics project in the last year of college. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Outside of school, I enjoy reading historical fiction and playing on my Switch!

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
								<h4>Kumon</h4>
								<p>
									I started working my first job in the summer of 2019 as a grader at Kumon, an 
									educational center for children. My mother was the one who encouraged me to apply and 
									I have been there until August 2021 when I moved for college. I have always liked working 
									with kids and the idea of sharing my knowledge and skills was appealing to me. At this job, 
									I have learned so much in regards to communication, patience, discipline, and problem-solving. 
									I have formed close bonds with the students there and have fostered a safe space for 
									them to share vulnerable moments with me. I am eternally grateful to have been given the 
									opportunity to work here and I could not love this job more!
								</p>
								<h4>Private Tutoring</h4>
								<p>
									I started private tutoring kids in October 2020 until August 2021. It was honestly a completely new 
									experience for me since I had never tutored one-on-one completely by myself. Nevertheless, I went in 
									both excited and curious as to how I would help the students. It was definitely hard at first, 
									especially to get the kids to warm up to both me and learning outside of school. Now, both kids have 
									a great relationship with me and are willing and eager to learn. Making my own lesson plans based on what 
									they already know was a new experience for me, but I now know them well enough that it is easy for me 
									to create lessons. Watching them grow into better students always brings delight in my heart and I 
									am so excited to see how far they will go. I am happy to say that they were able to reach their grade 
									level and a little higher through my guidance. As a teacher, I am incredibly proud of their progress 
									and wish them all the best!
								</p>
								<h4>Pre-Calculus Essentials Tutoring</h4>
								<p>
									At this job, I was a teaching assistant for a pre-calculus course for freshmen at UC Berkeley. I did this
									in the summers of 2021 and 2022. It was a connecting course for incoming students to understand what 
									college mathematics is like and to prepare them for it. I led one or two groups where I reviewed material 
									they had learned that day and went over practice problems. This job required training where I learned 
									pedagogy, including different forms of active learning, and applied it to my work. I also participated 
									in communicating with my fellow tutors on different ways to engage students in activities. This job 
									allowed me to form bonds with the students and prepare them for the rigors of college, while also assuring 
									them that they are capable of achieving their goals. 
								</p>
								<h4>Python DeCal</h4>
								<p>
									I started teaching for the Python DeCal in Fall 2021 as an intern and am now the head instructor. It is a 
									student-led course that teaches Python geared towards astronomy students. I originally took the course 
									myself the previous semester when I was an intended astrophysics major. I really enjoyed the course and 
									decided to intern for it! Since I was unable to join synchronously, I was tasked with grading assignments. 
									It was not until the next semester that I became a full time instructor. I taught lectures, made Python 
									guides and held my own office hours. As head instructor, I take care of logistical tasks alongside my other 
									responsibilities. Through this, I have learned how to lead a team, teach larger groups of students, work 
									better with students one-on-one in person, communicate programming ideas, problem-solving, and collaboration. 
									I can't wait to see how the course develops as my team grows as teachers!
