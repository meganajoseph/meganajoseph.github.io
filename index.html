									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! I’m Megan Joseph, a recent graduate of UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Data Science, focusing on robotics. Currently, I work as a consultant at Control 
									Plane, where I design and implement innovative solutions, including a chatbot for documentation using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. 
									My work involves optimizing data processing, fine-tuning models, and ensuring scalability.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition to my technical work, I have a passion for teaching. I’ve had the opportunity to teach math at various levels, from 5th grade to AP Calculus, 
									as a Math Teacher at the Education Enrichment Center and as a Teaching Assistant for a pre-calculus course at UC Berkeley. I’ve also led Python courses 
									geared towards UC Berkeley astrophysics and physics students. These experiences have honed my skills in communication, leadership, and problem-solving, 
									and they have deepened my commitment to education.
								</p>
								<p>
									During my time at UC Berkeley, I gained extensive experience in robotics, with projects like a voice-controlled robot car and an embedded systems 
									lane-keeping robot. Outside of work, I enjoy reading historical fiction, crocheting, and playing video games. Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue 
									exploring the intersection of data science, robotics, and artificial intelligence in my career.

									<h2>Teaching</h2>
								</header>
							
								<h4>Kumon</h4>
								<p>
									I began my teaching journey in the summer of 2019 as a grader at Kumon, an educational center for children. 
									This role, which I held until August 2021, allowed me to develop essential skills in communication, patience, 
									and problem-solving. I formed strong bonds with the students, creating a supportive environment where they felt 
									comfortable sharing their challenges. I’m incredibly grateful for the experience, which deepened my passion for education.
								</p>
							
								<h4>Private Tutoring</h4>
								<p>
									From October 2020 to August 2021, I provided private tutoring for elementary students. This one-on-one tutoring 
									experience was both challenging and rewarding, as I created customized lesson plans and worked closely with each 
									student to help them achieve and exceed their grade level. Watching them grow and develop a love for learning 
									has been one of my proudest accomplishments as a teacher.
								</p>
							
								<h4>Pre-Calculus Essentials Tutoring / Math 1 Undergraduate Student Instructor</h4>

								<h5>Pre-Calculus Essentials Tutoring (Summer 2021 & 2022)</h5>
								<p>
									During the summers of 2021 and 2022, I served as a teaching assistant for a pre-calculus course at UC Berkeley. 
									My responsibilities included leading group sessions, reviewing daily material, 
									and applying active learning strategies to engage students. I also collaborated with fellow
									 tutors to enhance the learning experience, helping students build confidence and prepare for college-level mathematics.
								</p>

								<h5>Math 1 Undergraduate Student Instructor (Fall 2023)</h5>
								<p>
									In Fall 2023, I transitioned to a bi-semester course as an undergraduate student instructor. I held two discussion 
									sessions each week, where I went over course material and addressed student questions. In addition, I conducted 
									office hours twice a week and graded weekly homework assignments. My class consisted of a 
									diverse group of students eager to learn, and it was a pleasure working with them.
								</p>
							
								<h4>Python DeCal</h4>
								<p>
									I joined the Python DeCal course at UC Berkeley in Fall 2021 as an intern and quickly transitioned to the role 
									of head instructor. This student-led course focuses on teaching Python, particularly for astronomy students. 
									As head instructor, I am responsible for leading lectures, developing curriculum, creating Python guides, 
									and managing logistical tasks. This experience has honed my skills in leadership, teaching, and collaboration, 
									and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the growth of the course.

							<!-- Pololu Lane Keeping Project -->
							<section>
								<h4>Pololu Lane Keeping</h4>
								<p>
									Pololu Lane Keeping is a project from an embedded systems class I 
									took. We worked on a robot car called Pololu and enabled it to detect
									 lanes, drive, and perform lane changes. It uses a camera, a 
									 Raspberry Pi 4, and OpenCV to achieve this functionality. The 
									 Raspberry Pi was connected to the Pololu via UART.
								</p>
								<p>
									To detect lanes, we applied a Gaussian filter to eliminate noise and 
									a binary filter to process the images from the camera. As this was 
									an embedded systems project, we developed different modes for the 
									Pololu based on the lane positions received from the Raspberry Pi. 
									Proportional feedback was used to ensure the car drove straight and 
									adjusted turns properly.

							<!-- S1XT33N Project -->
							<section>
								<h4>S1XT33N</h4>
								<p>
									S1XT33N is a project I worked on in EECS16B, an introduction course 
									to applied machine learning. The project involved creating a robot 
									car named "Honey" that listens to voice commands and follows a 
									specified path. We assembled the car from a kit and designed the 
									circuits and code ourselves.
								</p>
								<p>
									We built motor control circuits, regulator circuits, a microphone 
									board, and both low and high pass filters. A linear model was 
									created to model the noise in the signal, and we used feedback and 
									a closed loop to ensure the car traveled straight and turned 
									correctly. We also implemented clustering analysis to classify 
									words as commands, all written in C using an Arduino. Commands 
									included "honey," "uu," "dddd," and "durian."
								</p>
								<p>
									This project has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my 
									journey towards data science. My interest in robotics started in 
									high school, and this class gave me the opportunity to explore it 
									further. Through this project, I greatly improved my circuitry and 
									debugging skills. The most challenging aspect was selecting commands 
									that classified well in theory but were difficult to recognize when 
									spoken. Despite these challenges, this project remains my favorite, 
									and I am excited to apply the skills I gained in future endeavors.

							<!-- Build Your Own World (BYOW) Project -->
							<section>
								<h4>Build Your Own World (BYOW)</h4>
								<p>
									Build Your Own World was a project for COMPSCI 61BL, a lab-based 
									data structures and algorithms class in Java. In this project, we 
									created a pseudorandomly generated world that changes depending on 
									the input seed. The project included a main menu that allowed users 
									to generate a world, load a saved world, pick an avatar, and name 
									the avatar.
								</p>
								<p>
									The world was composed of tiles, and we developed an engine to 
									generate it. In each world, the avatar's name and the current date 
									and time were displayed at the top. The world also featured 
									teleportation tiles, event games where the player had to collect 
									good coins and avoid bad ones, and a final puzzle that required the 
									player to input a phrase made up of code words obtained by winning 
									the event games. Although we couldn't implement the load feature in 
									time, the rest of the project was completed successfully.
								</p>

							<!-- Gitlet Project -->
							<section>
								<h4>Gitlet</h4>
								<p>
									Gitlet was another project from COMPSCI 61BL. For this project, I 
									developed a version control system similar to Git. The system 
									allowed saving directories, restoring versions, viewing history, 
									maintaining branches, and merging changes.
								</p>
								<p>
									This was the most challenging project in the class as we were given 
									minimal guidance and had to figure out most of the implementation on 
									our own. Despite the difficulty, we successfully implemented all 
									features except the checkout feature. Through this project, I 
									learned a great deal about data structures and how to apply them in 
									a real-world context.
